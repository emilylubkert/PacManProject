# PacMan project

## Description
This is a project I created in Week 4 of MITxPro Professional Certificate in Coding (Full Stack Dev). I used 4 PacMan images that were placed in an array, and then alternated to show PacMan opening and closing his mouth as well as changing direction.

PacMan changed direction when he reached the edge of the window because of a boolean named 'direction'. When PacMan reached either edge (based on the left position of the image), the value of direction would switch. A true value caused a value to be added to the image's position, making it move to the right; a false value reversed this.

Initial code and instructions for this project were provided by MITxPro program staff. This project was part of a required assignment.
